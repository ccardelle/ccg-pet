# CCG-Pet Project

## Introduction

> Take home project: Full Stack MERN project that displays data from the API and displays it. Filter the data using optional filters. Deadline ~2 Days

## Description

> Very basic front-end display for fetched API data. Backend is Node with Express, Mongo as the database. using React for the front end. No style libraries were used.
> Seeded the database manually to simulate fetching from an API.
>It was important that I minimize API calls. Initial page load pulls the API data and then all filtering is done on it locally.

## Things I Would Have Changed (given more time)

> The most important thing I would like to change is the filter options. Would have preferred to have made them populate automatically given the API data. Currently, they are hardcoded. It would make the project easily scalable.
> Obviously styling needs to be addressed. My focus was on the backend and functionality. Left styling for the very end. It is very basic.
> The app is not fully mobile responsive. It adjusts properly but needs a lot more fine tuning to make sure it looks good.
